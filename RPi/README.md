When doing the "Develop and deploy a C# IoT Edge module to your simulated device - preview" tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-csharp-module), it only provides "linux-64" and "windows-nano" docker files. The reason is the docker images are based on .Net Core 2.0 which has not officially supported ARM yet. However, there's a docker image (microsoft/dotnet:2.0.0-runtime-stretch-arm32v7) built for ARM which is currently supported by community. If you would like to build a docker image for an Azure IoT Edge module for RPi, you can use this docker file and follow the rest steps of the steps in the tutorial.
